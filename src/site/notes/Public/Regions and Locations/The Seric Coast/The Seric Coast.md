# Overview

The Seric Coast is a slender nation cradled by mountains to the north and west, and kissed by the ocean to the south and east. Its people are wind-sailors, sky-dancers, and artisans of breathtaking ingenuity, building cities that stretch both upward and outward, catching every whisper of the coastal gales. Life here is light and vibrant—few places in the world feel so alive with color, movement, and song.

# Population

Roughly 1.1 million people make their homes along the steep coastal terraces and sprawling harbor cities. The population is primarily human, though a notable number of gnomes, kenku, and aarakocra have found the open skies of Seric welcoming.

# Government

The Seric Coast is a confederation of city-states, each ruled by a Merchant Prince or Princess. Every seven years, these rulers convene to elect a Doge—who serves more as a figurehead and arbiter than a sovereign, ensuring the nation’s many cities sail in harmony.

# Religion

Worship revolves around twin wind deities: **Ailan**, the gentle breeze who brings inspiration, and **Vormas**, the roaring gale who tests the mettle of mortals. Temples, often towering pagodas open to the air, host ceremonies where silk banners and incense are offered to please the wandering spirits of the wind.

# Commerce

Trade is the lifeblood of Seric. Spices, silk, intricate wind-craft devices, and lightweight enchanted wood are their chief exports. Sky ships and massive wind-driven wagons haul goods across both the sea and inland passes, while cliffside markets bustle with merchants and travelers.

# Notable Locations

- **Zephyr Port:** The largest harbor, with piers that extend far into the sapphire sea to catch favorable winds.
    
- **The Lifting Yards:** Where new sky ships and vast wind-gliders are built, tested, and launched from stone runways.
    
- **Kite Gardens of Yansho:** Terraced parks in the capital city where families gather to fly elaborate kites in displays of art and competition.
    
- **Temple of Ailan & Vormas:** A vast twin-spired sanctuary that resonates with hundreds of hanging chimes, always singing in the sea winds.
    

# Atmosphere

Every day in the Seric Coast feels like the opening of a festival. Lanterns bob through streets at night; dancers perform on rooftop platforms that sway with the wind. Conversations are as light and playful as the breeze, but beneath the laughter is a fierce pride—no people know the winds or honor them better than the Sericans.
