 - The Redwynn Empire
	 - A kingdom spreading along the west coast of the eastern continent, spanning rolling hills, dense forests, towering mountains, and beautiful coastlines.
	 - Monarchy
 - Tzicali Basin
	 - Jungle cities built atop titanic stone golems left by ancient gods, who still roam on occasion. Their astronomer-priests chart the stars to predict when the god-machines will stir.
	 - Theocracy
 - Shatari Dominion
	 - Lush jungles and jeweled palaces sit atop living roots of an ancient world-tree whose sap is a potent source of both life and monstrous mutations. The ruling dynasties maintain vast menageries of magical beasts, both status symbol and defense.
 - Korrandi League
	 - A collection of fiercely independent city-states ruled by merchant houses and artist-mages. The land itself has been altered by generations of reality-shaping art — statues that walk, gardens that grow from song, canals that shift to avoid invaders.
