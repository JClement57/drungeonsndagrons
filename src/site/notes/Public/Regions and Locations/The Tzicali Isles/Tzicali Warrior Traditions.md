In the Tzicali Isles, martial tradition runs deep — a reflection of the archipelago’s tumultuous history and fractured political landscape. Though magic and faith are foundational forces, it is often the warriors who decide the fates of lords and lands. Two dominant martial paths define the warrior caste: the **Tiwi** and the **Balamí** — rivals in both philosophy and form.

# Martial Traditions
## The Tiwi
Known as the _Sky-Wardens_, the Tiwi draw inspiration from the eagle — a sacred creature in Tzicali culture, revered for its vision, grace, and freedom. Tiwi warriors are sworn to uphold ideals of **peace, honor, and protection**, acting as guardians of their communities and keepers of old codes. Clad in colorful lamellar armor adorned with feathered motifs, they wield curved blades and longbows with artful precision. Tiwi clans are deeply tied to their temples and often serve as spiritual and military protectors for villages and noble estates. Though disciplined and peace-seeking, they will not hesitate to fight when justice demands it.

## The Balamí
The _Shadowclaws_, or Balamí, are feared and respected across the isles — agile, brutal warriors who embody the jaguar’s silent hunt and lethal pounce. Unlike the Tiwi, the **Balamí** embrace **strength, cunning, and decisive power**. Once warriors in service to noble houses, many **Balamí** became untethered in times of upheaval, evolving into feared mercenaries, duelists, or assassins-for-hire. Their armor is darkened and low-slung, built for speed and stealth, with jaguar-tooth patterns engraved into their weapons. Though some still serve their clans with pride, others answer only to coin, leaving their loyalties ever in question.


# Warrior Compounds (Inku)
Both Tiwi and Balamí reside in clan compounds, or **Inku**. These fortified strongholds are part dojo, part family estate, and part temple, where martial arts, honor codes, and history are passed down through generations. Clans will sometimes operate independently of the feudal lords, but most are entangled in the shifting alliances and power struggles that shape the Tzicali political theater.
