# The Shattered Reach
Long before written memory, the world was a single sprawling landmass — a cradle where titans walked, gods contended, and mortal kingdoms first took root. This unity was violently undone in the Cataclysm of Sundering, a world-rending upheaval said to have been caused by warring deities or a reckless spell of unimaginable scale. Mountains split, rivers boiled into steam, and fissures swallowed whole empires. When the world stilled, a vast ocean stood where fertile plains once stretched, forever dividing the continents and scattering countless islands like shattered jewels across the waters.

Even now, sages debate the true cause of the Sundering, poring over fragmentary myths and cryptic ruins. Meanwhile, sailors and merchants ply the seas born of that long-ago devastation, unknowingly tracing the scars of an ancient wound with every voyage. This ocean stands as both a bridge and a barrier between civilizations, its depths hiding echoes of the world that once was.

## The Redwynn Empire

[[Public/Regions and Locations/The Redwynn Empire/The Redwynn Empire\|The Redwynn Empire]] is a mighty kingdom sprawling along the western coast of the eastern continent.

The Redwynn Empire is ruled by a monarch — currently Queen Alandra Vaelwyn — but each major city maintains its own elected mayor, balancing the interests of local governance with imperial decree. This mix of monarchy and civic democracy, alongside its thriving guilds, makes it a hub of trade, politics, and intrigue.
