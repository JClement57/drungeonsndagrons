# The Shattered Reach
Long before written memory, the world was a single sprawling landmass — a cradle where titans walked, celestials contended, and mortal kingdoms first took root. This unity was violently undone in the cataclysm of the Shattering, a world-rending upheaval said to have been caused by warring stars or a reckless spell of unimaginable scale. Mountains split, rivers boiled into steam, and fissures swallowed whole empires. When the world stilled, a vast ocean stood where fertile plains once stretched, forever dividing the continents and scattering countless islands like shattered jewels across the waters.

Even now, sages debate the true cause of the Shattering, poring over fragmentary myths and cryptic ruins. Meanwhile, sailors and merchants ply the seas born of that long-ago devastation, unknowingly tracing the scars of an ancient wound with every voyage. This ocean stands as both a bridge and a barrier between civilizations, its depths hiding echoes of the world that once was.

## The Veildeep Ocean
The Veildeep is the ocean that  separates the two continents main of The Shattered Reach. Legends say that it hides mysteries and ancient wreckage from the Shattering.

# Nations

## The Redwynn Empire

[[Public/Regions and Locations/The Redwynn Empire/0 - The Redwynn Empire\|0 - The Redwynn Empire]] is a mighty kingdom sprawling along the western coast of the eastern continent. Rolling hills give way to dense forests, jagged mountain ranges, and breathtaking coastlines dotted with bustling ports. The Redwynn Empire is ruled by a monarch — currently Queen Alandra Vaelwyn — but each major city maintains its own elected mayor, balancing the interests of local governance with imperial decree. This mix of monarchy and civic democracy, alongside its thriving guilds, makes it a hub of trade, politics, and intrigue.

*Think: Classic coastal fantasy setting. A melting pot of races, cultures and religions due to the coastal trading nature of the nation.*

## The Tzicali Isles

[[Public/Regions and Locations/The Tzicali Isles/The Tzicali Isles\|The Tzicali Isles]] form a striking archipelago of verdant, misty islands scattered across warm tropical seas. Beneath their vibrant jungles lie titanic, dormant forms of ancient titans — colossal remnants from a war of the celestials, whose uneasy slumber occasionally sends tremors across the land.

*Think: Feudal Japan with lords and ladies ruling small portions of the region, all submitting to a singular king. Aesthetically the Tzicali isles resemble Mayan tradition and architecture with bright colors and decorating their clothes and buildings.*

## The Tyrasil Dominion

A realm of lush jungles and resplendent jeweled palaces, the Tyrasil Dominion thrives atop the living roots of a primordial world-tree. Its sap brings both miraculous life and horrifying mutations, a power closely guarded by the ruling dynasties. Emperors and nobles maintain vast menageries of magical beasts — status symbols as much as formidable weapons — creating a society where wonder and terror walk hand in hand.

*Think: Wood-elves and humanoid animal-folk dominate this realm. Essentially forest cities where the buildings are built into the canopy. Imagine the Ewok village.*

---

## The Korrandi League

Renowned for its towering academies and vibrant art halls, the Korrandi League is a constellation of independent city-states. Merchant houses, master artisans, and brilliant mages constantly push the limits of magic, technology, fashion, and philosophy. Fiercely competitive yet dazzlingly progressive, the League stands as the intellectual and cultural heart of the world.

*Think: Renaissance Italy. A cultural hub for innovation in technology, fashion, and politics. This has led to a huge societal wealth gap. Basically hunger games districts with the uber wealthy and the super poor.*

## The Seric Coast

The **Seric Coast** is a radiant maritime nation famed for its relationship with the wind. A place of airy towers, painted pagodas, and cliffside cities, the very air seems alive with bright sails, drifting lanterns, and a thousand vibrant kites. From elegant sky ships to daring gliders, the people of Seric trust the breath of the sea to carry them. Festivals are constant, color is everywhere, and joy seems to dance on every breeze.

*Think: Air nomads. That's all I've got so far lol.*

---

## The Varrholm Confederacy

Frost giants once ruled here, and their lingering magic makes the winters sentient — the snow whispers, blizzards seek vengeance, and auroras can open gates to the spirit realms. The people ride giant elk and sail longships that can glide over both water and ice.

*Think: Scandinavian viking culture mixed with waterbender villages.*

---

## The Aetheric Reaches

Far above the surface world lies the Aetheric Reaches: a realm of floating islands adrift in a vast sky-ocean roiled by endless storms. Airships with sails spun from woven spells traverse these magical currents, connecting sky ports and cloud fortresses. Governed by councils elected by free peoples, the Reaches represent a fragile democratic web in a place where the laws of gravity — and often reality — are not to be trusted.

*Think: Floating islands above the ocean.*

---

## The Amber Sultanates

Golden deserts stretch beneath sun-bleached skies where mighty cities rise vertically, built upon foundations of reddish, nearly indestructible glass forged from the very sands below. Each towering city is ruled by a Sultan, whose authority balances lavish patronage of the arts with iron control over water and trade. Intricate glasswork, opulent bazaars, and vibrant festivals bloom in this harsh yet dazzling land.

*Think: Desert arabic cultures. Sand people who have become adept at navigating the harsh environment.*
