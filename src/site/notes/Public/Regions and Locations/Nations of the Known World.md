## The Redwynn Empire

[[Public/Regions and Locations/The Redwynn Empire/The Redwynn Empire\|The Redwynn Empire]] is a mighty kingdom sprawling along the western coast of the eastern continent. Rolling hills give way to dense forests, jagged mountain ranges, and breathtaking coastlines dotted with bustling ports. The Redwynn Empire is ruled by a monarch — currently Queen Alandra Vaelwyn — but each major city maintains its own elected mayor, balancing the interests of local governance with imperial decree. This mix of monarchy and civic democracy, alongside its thriving guilds, makes it a hub of trade, politics, and intrigue.

## The Tzicali Isles

[[Public/Regions and Locations/The Tzicali Isles/The Tzicali Isles\|The Tzicali Isles]] form a striking archipelago of verdant, misty islands scattered across warm tropical seas. Beneath their vibrant jungles lie titanic, dormant forms of ancient god-beasts — colossal remnants from a war of the gods, whose uneasy slumber occasionally sends tremors across the land.

## The Tyrasil Dominion

A realm of lush jungles and resplendent jeweled palaces, the Tyrasil Dominion thrives atop the living roots of a primordial world-tree. Its sap brings both miraculous life and horrifying mutations, a power closely guarded by the ruling dynasties. Emperors and nobles maintain vast menageries of magical beasts — status symbols as much as formidable weapons — creating a society where wonder and terror walk hand in hand.

## The Korrandi League

Renowned for its towering academies and vibrant art halls, the Korrandi League is a constellation of independent city-states. Merchant houses, master artisans, and brilliant mages constantly push the limits of magic, technology, fashion, and philosophy. Fiercely competitive yet dazzlingly progressive, the League stands as the intellectual and cultural heart of the world.

## The Aetheric Reaches

Far above the surface world lies the Aetheric Reaches: a realm of floating islands adrift in a vast sky-ocean roiled by endless storms. Airships with sails spun from woven spells traverse these magical currents, connecting sky ports and cloud fortresses. Governed by councils elected by free peoples, the Reaches represent a fragile democratic web in a place where the laws of gravity — and often reality — are not to be trusted.

## The Amber Sultanates

Golden deserts stretch beneath sun-bleached skies where mighty cities rise vertically, built upon foundations of reddish, nearly indestructible glass forged from the very sands below. Each towering city is ruled by a Sultan, whose authority balances lavish patronage of the arts with iron control over water and trade. Intricate glasswork, opulent bazaars, and vibrant festivals bloom in this harsh yet dazzling land.
