## Overview

Emberwatch is the second-largest city in the kingdom, a thriving hub of trade and defense located **about a half-day's boatride up river from the western coast**, linked to the sea by the wide and navigable **Ravenflow River**. Merchant vessels, fishing boats, and river barges travel daily between Emberwatch and the coastal ports, making the city a vital artery for commerce.

Its imposing walls and towers stand as both deterrent and promise — a city that has endured for generations, proud of its role as the western guardian of the realm.

At the heart of Emberwatch rises the blackstone **Ember Tower**, crowned with a magical flame that burns eternally and can be seen even from the coast. It remains the city’s defining landmark and symbol.

## Population

Approximately **22,000 permanent residents**, bolstered by a constant influx of traders, sailors, craftsmen, and adventurers. The people of Emberwatch are industrious and proud, though whispers of growing dangers beyond the city have begun to unsettle them.

## Government

Emberwatch is governed by an **elected mayor**, chosen by the citizenry every five years, who works in concert (and frequent contention) with a **council of guildmasters**. Each major guild elects its own representative, giving them a powerful voice in city affairs.

While the mayor seeks to balance the interests of all, the guildmasters often feud over resources and influence, making politics in Emberwatch a delicate dance. All ultimately serve under the authority of the kingdom’s monarch, though the crown rarely intervenes directly.

Smaller shrines to Chauntea, Moradin, Lathander, and other gods are scattered throughout neighborhoods and marketplaces.

## The People & Atmosphere

Emberwatch’s citizens are proud of their city’s reputation as the western shield of the kingdom. They place trust in their walls, the disciplined guard, and the longstanding traditions of governance that have kept them safe for centuries.

Yet recently, troubling tales from merchants and guards — of vanished caravans, mysterious lights in the forests, and ships that never return — have begun to sow quiet worry. Most dismiss these fears, convinced the city is too strong to truly be threatened. Whether that faith is well-placed remains to be seen.
