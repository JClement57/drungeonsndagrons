## Government

### National Governance

The empire is ruled by **Queen Alandra Vaelwyn**, a sharp-witted sovereign renowned for both her diplomatic finesse and her uncompromising enforcement of the empire’s interests abroad.

### Local Governance

Each major city is largely autonomous in daily affairs, governed by an **elected mayor** who answers ultimately to the Queen. This layered system ensures local voices are heard but keeps the throne’s authority intact.

## Economy

The Redwynn Empire thrives on trade. Merchant guilds and artisan syndicates wield enormous influence, funding civic projects, sponsoring festivals, and sometimes even employing private guards or spies. This fierce competition for wealth drives innovation — but also greed.

Where coin flows freely, shadows inevitably gather. Smuggling, extortion, and clandestine pacts flourish beneath Redwynn’s glittering facade. Some say certain mayors even turn a blind eye, provided their coffers stay full.

## Culture & Reputation

Redwynners are proud, fashion-conscious, and quick to boast of their empire’s wealth. Festivals honoring trade victories and exotic foreign fairs are common, filling the streets with color, song, and visiting merchants from faraway lands.
