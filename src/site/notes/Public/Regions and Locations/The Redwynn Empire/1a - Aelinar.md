## Overview

Aelinar, often called **“the Twin Thrones,”** serves as the proud capital of the Redwynn Empire. The city straddles the wide, emerald Virendale River about three miles inland from the western coast, uniting what were once two rival hill-cities—now just called the western and eastern cities—into a single bustling heart of trade, culture, and politics. Elegant bridges, lively ferries, and floating markets stitch the two halves together, creating a cityscape as dynamic as it is beautiful.

## Population

Home to roughly **100,000 people**, Aelinar draws folk from all around the continent. Neighborhoods often have distinct characters reflecting the blend of backgrounds. Festivals, local rivalries, and shared pride in their city keep the population tightly knit despite the cosmopolitan swirl.

## Government

Aelinar is ruled by **Queen Elayne IV**, who oversees imperial matters from her grand palace on an artificial island at the river’s center—symbolizing unity between East and West.  

Locally, the city is managed by:
- **The Mayor of Aelinar**, elected every five years by the people.
- **The Council of Guildmasters**, who represent powerful trade and artisan guilds. They often spar over laws and influence, forcing the mayor to balance conflicting interests.

Though under the Queen’s banner, the city is very much steered by the competing ambitions of guilds and the democratic voice of its citizens.

## Religion

Temples, shrines, and quiet chapels pepper Aelinar. Worship of **Tyr (justice)**, **Mystra (magic)**, and **Waukeen (trade)** is especially prominent, though countless smaller shrines to local saints and river spirits appear on bridges and near bustling marketplaces. Festivals often weave together religious observances and commerce, with river processions lit by floating lanterns dedicated to Mystra or lavish charity feasts in Tyr’s honor.

## Notable Locations

- **The Twin Keeps:** ancient fortresses atop each hill, now grand halls for ceremonies and visiting nobles.
    
- **The Sapphire Walk:** a bridge lit by thousands of tiny magical lanterns that glow like starlight, a favorite spot for evening strolls and clandestine meetings.
    
- **The Floating Gardens:** vast gardens set on river barges, growing rare herbs and flowers, used for private gatherings and lovers’ rendezvous.
    
- **House of the Silver Star:** the city’s most impressive temple to Mystra, where mages meet under vaulted ceilings of sapphire glass.
    
- **The Market of Bells:** an open bazaar famous for hundreds of wind chimes and enchanted instruments that fill the air with song.

## Atmosphere

Life in Aelinar is a swirl of **festival colors, spirited debates, and quiet rivalries**. Pride runs deep—East vs. West still playfully compete in boat races, street performances, and even petty pranks. Yet, when the river glows during the **Luminous Run**, the city stands united, marveling at the beauty of their shared home. The scent of river lilies and spice carts mingles in the air, lanterns drift across the water, and laughter rings out from taverns perched along every hill and quay.
