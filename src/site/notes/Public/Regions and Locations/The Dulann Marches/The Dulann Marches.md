In the far North of the eastern continent of Caelthys lies the frozen wasteland of **the Dulann Marches**.

Dulann is a harsh alliance of warlord clans who carve their homes into the frozen mountains and volcanoes of the North. They trust strength far more than the distant sun, moon, or stars that long ago abandoned them. Each clan rules its own domain, united only by **the Kraal**—a leader chosen through ritual combat when the previous ruler dies—and by their shared belief that power is earned, never granted. 

Cities in the Dulann Marches are built inside and around mountains and volcanoes that were erected by powerful mages (see [[#Origins]]) only decades after the Twilight Rebellion. The mages wielded the power of seams to construct mountains and these seams now serve as magical power for the cities that rest upon them. Heightened magical power has led to Dulann people to lean on their own magical prowess rather than relying on gods or celestials to help them. 

## Government
The Dulann Marches are first and foremost led by the **Kraal** - a position that is earned through a ritual tournament upon the death of the previous Kraal. This ensures that the most powerful stand at the helm of the nation. The Kraal is responsible for upholding Dulannese tradition, coordinating tribes against foreign invaders, and operating as the external face of the Marches to the outside world. 

The Kraal leads over several **clans** that make up Dulann. Each clan is led by a **Rann** who guides the clan in their militaristic and economic pursuits. While the title of Kraal is earned through ritual combat, the mantle of Rann passes down to the next-of-kin upon death. Only in the case of a direct takeover does the position pass to a new family. 

## Culture
Dulannese people are taught from the day that they are born that they must earn their keep in the world. At an early age they choose (or are assigned) a path to contribute to their clan, often following in their parents footsteps. Their tribal societies are fiercely competitive but deeply collaborative. Each member of a clan knows their position and fills it diligently, making Dulannese clans well-oiled machines when not plagued by infighting or mutiny.

## Origins
Originally, the lands in the north of Caelthys were rich plains and flatlands teeming with life, joy, and civilization. During [[Public/World Overview/The History of Caelthys/1 - The Twilight Rebellion/The War\|the Twilight Rebellion]] these plains were the site of many fierce battles. These battles scarred the once-beautiful landscape. Flat green plains became rugged frigid wastelands. 
The rebellion scattered [[Public/World Overview/Magic/The Seams\|Seams]] all across the Northern reaches of Caelthys. An old mage named Haldor sought to harness this power for himself. He used the great power of one of the seams to erect a mountain around the seam, and thus Haldorfjell (Haldor's mountain) was founded. As Haldor's tribe grew, he and other powerful arcanists traversed the inhospitable wilderness of the North and erected more mountain cities on seams across the northern plains. This nation eventually became known as **The Dulann Marches**.
