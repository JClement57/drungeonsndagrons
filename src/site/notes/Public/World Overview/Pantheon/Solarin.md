**Solarin** is the original force in the universe—the first spark, the primal fire, the shaper of reality. He created the world, the heavens, and time itself. All structure, all logic, all things that function according to rules and patterns fall under his dominion.

He is a deity of stability and certainty. Day follows night because he commands it. Civilization, law, and the natural world—all are expressions of his divine order.

The Sun is revered as the ultimate power in the cosmos. Though distant, his light touches all things. He rarely intervenes directly, instead working through his divine stewards: the Stars.

### Description
Solarin is the oldest and most powerful of the divine. He is the origin of life, warmth, and form—the divine forge from which all that exists was shaped. Solarin's light not only brings clarity but **creates**. His radiance gives birth to forests, breathes life into the land, and fuels the crafts of mortals and gods alike.

He is the **cosmic order**, the divine architect who set the stars in motion and granted dominion to the lesser gods. Though benevolent, Solarin is stern—unyielding in his standards, favoring those who bring structure to chaos, and build rather than destroy.

### Personality
Majestic, unwavering, and paternal. Solarin speaks rarely but when he does, his words become law. He does not suffer betrayal but shows infinite patience to those who strive to better themselves. He expects duty, discipline, and service to the greater good.

### Worshippers
Clerics, druids, blacksmiths, judges, rulers, and those who seek the light—literally and spiritually. Many farmers and creators pray to Solarin at dawn.
