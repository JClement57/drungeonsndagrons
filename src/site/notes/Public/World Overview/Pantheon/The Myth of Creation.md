## Creation
In the beginning, Solarin the Sun shaped the heavens and Caelthys, “Heaven’s Earth.” The stars were his legion, bound each to a domain: justice, harvest, war, hearth, luck, and countless more. The world was perfect, predictable, bathed always in his light.

Solarin, recognizing that while the perfect order was good, it was bland. Thus Solarin created the moon - Lunira. She brought a sprinkle of variety that made Caelthys no longer perfectly predictable, but all the more beautiful. The gift of the moon was brought cycles of change, adding variety and stirring innovation. Day and night. Seasons. Tides. Invention. Caelthys saw a golden age as civilizations grew and propsered.

However Solarin had not foreseen that the introduction of change would also lead to conflict. Mortals were given dreams, imagination, emotions, and doubts. His gift paved the way for greed the eventually led to wars amongst the civilizations that had been growing so beautifully. The perfect order was brought into discord. 

Yet Solarin stood by. There was beauty even in the chaos. Many chose greed and evil, but some yet chose good. Solarin would not intervene, allowing the fate of the world to determine if the power of good would outweigh the power of evil.

## The Twilight Rebellion
As free-will entered into the cosmos, Solarin recognized the need for a system of law and discipline to be put into place to make sure that this ebb and flow of life could maintain it's course uninterrupted. He created the [[Public/World Overview/Pantheon/Celestial Law\|Celestial Law]] - a set of rules thatall celestials were required to abide by. He forged **the Solar Brand** - a radiant spear of judgement - in the heat of his own flares that could banish celestials down to the mortal plane if they broke this law. While some appreciated the order that this law brought, others saw Solarin as a tyrant of the heavens and they sought to remove him from his throne.

**Vaelen** was the star that was granted dominion over liberty and freedom. As he aided mortals in breaking their own chains he grew in contempt for the way that Solarin reign over the heavens. He believed that Solarin's fist stifled the potential of the celestial beings and that even the celestials should be able to grow and evolve. 

Vaelen despised Solarin's reign to the point where he snuck into the palace of Solarin in an attempt to steal the Solar Brand so that he could wield it himself and banish Solarin to the mortal plane instead. In his attempt he was caught by Solarin, but not before grabbing the tool. Before Solarin could stop him, Vaelen used all of his power to throw the spear into the material plane to keep it from Solarin in hopes that *someone* would be able to challenge him. Solarin was enraged and, in an act that has not since been repeated, engulfed this lesser celestial in a radiant flame and snuffed him from existence. Some say that Vaelen now exists in the black void between the star where no light can shine.

The rogue became a martyr. Since conflict in the heavens amongst immortal beings was futile celestials who were angered by Solarin's outburst sent champions down to the mortal plane to fetch the tool in hopes of completing Vaelen's mission. These became known as the ***Aspirants***. Others that remained sided with Solarin - the **Faithbound*** - sent their own champions to challenge the Aspirants on the mortal plane in order to return the Solar Brand to Solarin.

Elemental titans, dragons, and chosen mortals all served as avatars for the stars and fought for their patrons. Seas boiled, mountains split, and Caelthys shattered into fragments. The continent was torn asunder and it now goes by a new name - **the Shattered Reach**.

In the end, the **Faithbound triumphed.** The Aspirants were stripped of their starfire and cast down, cursed to walk as mortals among the broken world they had marred. The heavens held order once more, though scarred by the war.

## The Aftermath
Thousands of years have passed since then. The fallen Aspirants mingled with mortals, seeding bloodlines and civilizations, but never regaining their celestial thrones. The conflicts since then have been mortal ones — wars of greed, ambition, and pride, fought without the direct hand of the stars. The Faithbound remained distant, operating as good stewards of the dominions to which they were assigned, but fearful to step out of line.
