**Domains:** Peace, War, Knowledge, Arcana  
**Alignment:** True Neutral (with individual variance)  
**Symbol:** A cluster of seven stars with varying rays, sometimes depicted as eyes or weapons in the sky  
**Title(s):** The Starborn, The Legion Above, Watchers in the Void, Echoes of Flame

#### Description 
The **Stars** are not one, but **many**—a legion of celestial beings cast into the firmament by Solarin and Lunira. They are divine echoes, fragments of greater power entrusted with specific aspects of reality. Some are gods of war, others of serenity, others of ancient truth or forbidden magic.

Though they are lesser than Solarin and Lunira, each star is a **celestial being** in its own right. Mortals often choose a specific star to revere, but all are seen as part of the same radiant legion. Their light is the promise that knowledge and guidance endure, even in darkness.

#### Personality  
Varied and alien. Some stars are warm and compassionate, others cold and distant. A few whisper secrets in dreams, others inspire inventions or crusades. They are watchers and mentors, not creators.

#### Worshippers  
Scholars, mages, soldiers, monks, historians, seekers of peace or war. Some choose a single star to follow; others revere the Legion as a whole.
