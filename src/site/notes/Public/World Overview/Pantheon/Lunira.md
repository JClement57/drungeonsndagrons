### Description  
Where Solarin brings clarity, **Lunira** embraces the unknown. As the moon changes shape every night, she rules the **in-between**, the borderlands of life and death, dusk and dawn, silence and song. She governs storms, shadows, and the delicate balance of endings and beginnings.

Lunira does not create, but **transforms**. The dying find passage through her. The secrets whispered in dreams are hers to keep. Her beauty is mesmerizing and terrible—a face you can never see fully, a truth you feel but cannot name.

### Personality
Elusive, mercurial, and enigmatic. Lunira is a trickster, a mourner, a storm that passes as quickly as it comes. She speaks in riddles and dreams. She loves deeply and mourns eternally, especially the stars she once bore from Solarin’s fire.

### Worshippers  
Sailors, mourners, spies, storm-callers, gravekeepers, assassins, and dreamers. Many pray to her at dusk, especially those in grief or fear.
