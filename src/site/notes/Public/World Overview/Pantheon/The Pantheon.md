## The Celestial Triad
The **Celestial Triad** is the simplified divine structure of the cosmos, composed of **three tiers of divinity**:
1. **[[Public/World Overview/Pantheon/Solarin\|Solarin]], the Sun** – The supreme creator and overseer of order
2. **[[Public/World Overview/Pantheon/Lunira\|Lunira]], the Moon** – The goddess of transformation, death, and ambiguity
3. **[[The Stars \| The Cosmic Legion]], the Stars** – A vast and varied legion of lesser deities, appointed to rule over specific domains

Together, these forces shape the universe and influence every aspect of existence—light and shadow, life and death, knowledge and mystery.

### Divine Hierarchy
1. **The Sun** – Creator and overseer of structure, life, and the continuity of existence.
2. **The Moon** – Governs transformation, endings, and all that dwells between absolutes.
3. **The Stars** – Numerous lesser gods, each entrusted with a specific domain, acting as extensions of the Sun’s or Moon’s will.


### Balance and Divine Governance
The Triad is not a pantheon of conflict, but of **cosmic balance**. Solarin and Lunira do not represent good and evil, but light and dark, constant and change, push and pull, order and chaos. Their relationship creates the dynamic ebbing and flowing that makes the world worth living in. The stars operate as children or servants to the Sun and the Moon, helping to advance their goals.

- The **Sun** establishes the **constants** of reality.
- The **Moon** introduces **change** and ensures the cycle of creation and dissolution continues.
- The **Stars** maintain the **fine details**, serving as divine administrators over aspects such as war, peace, knowledge, storms, and magic.

This structure allows for both **order** and **mystery** to coexist within the divine cosmos, offering a rich tapestry of belief and devotion for mortals.

### Legend of Creation
- **Creation Myth:** [[Public/World Overview/Pantheon/Solarin\|Solarin]] forged the world from nothing, bringing order to the void. From his light and [[Public/World Overview/Pantheon/Lunira\|Lunira]]'s shadow, the Stars were born—each one carrying a shard of divinity to oversee different parts of existence.
  
- [[Public/World Overview/Pantheon/The Stars\|The Stars]], though distant, still serve their makers. They hold fragments of Solarin’s flame and Lunira’s dream. They do not rule, but they guide, each from their seat in the sky.
