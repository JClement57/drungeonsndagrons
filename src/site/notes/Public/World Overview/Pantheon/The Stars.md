The Stars are countless divine entities created by the Sun and Moon. They are **servants, champions, and stewards**, each entrusted with specific aspects of reality. These aspects—known as **domains**—are assigned by either the Sun or the Moon, depending on the nature of the domain and the will of the greater deity.

The Stars are not equal in power to the Sun or Moon. Their celestial power is **bestowed**, not inherent. Their authority is limited to the domain they are charged with, and their power is a reflection of the celestial forces that created them. Some are radiant and noble, others are subtle and strange. Mortals may choose to worship an individual Star, or revere the **Legion** as a collective whole.

While the Sun and Moon rarely manifest in the mortal world, the Stars often act more directly—serving as patrons to clerics, warlocks, and other divine agents.

#### Description 
The **Stars** are not one, but **many**—a legion of celestial beings cast into the firmament by [[Public/World Overview/Pantheon/Solarin\|Solarin]] and [[Public/World Overview/Pantheon/Lunira\|Lunira]]. They are divine echoes, fragments of greater power entrusted with specific aspects of reality. Some are gods of war, others of serenity, others of ancient truth or forbidden magic.

Though they are lesser than Solarin and Lunira, each star is a **celestial being** in its own right. Mortals often choose a specific star to revere, but all are seen as part of the same radiant legion. Their light is the promise that knowledge and guidance endure, even in darkness.

#### Personality  
Varied and alien. Some stars are warm and compassionate, others cold and distant. A few whisper secrets in dreams, others inspire inventions or crusades. They are watchers and mentors, not creators.

#### Worshippers  
Scholars, mages, soldiers, monks, historians, seekers of peace or war. Some choose a single star to follow; others revere the Legion as a whole.
