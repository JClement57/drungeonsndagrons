## Creation
In the beginning, Solarin the Sun shaped the heavens and Caelthys, “Heaven’s Earth.” The stars were his legion, bound each to a domain: justice, harvest, war, hearth, luck, and countless more. The world was perfect, predictable, bathed always in his light.

Solarin, recognizing that while the perfect order was good, it was bland. Thus Solarin created the moon - Lunira. She brought a sprinkle of variety that made Caelthys no longer perfectly predictable, but all the more beautiful. The gift of the moon was brought cycles of change, adding variety and stirring innovation. Day and night. Seasons. Tides. Invention. Caelthys saw a golden age as civilizations grew and propsered.

However Solarin had not foreseen that the introduction of change would also lead to conflict. Mortals were given dreams, imagination, emotions, and doubts. His gift paved the way for greed the eventually led to wars amongst the civilizations that had been growing so beautifully. The perfect order was brought into discord. 

Yet Solarin stood by. There was beauty even in the chaos. Many chose greed and evil, but some yet chose good. Solarin would not intervene, allowing the fate of the world to determine if the power of good would outweigh the power of evil.

## The Twilight Rebellion
Lunira's emergence brought instability to the mortal realm, but more importantly, it brought chaos amongst the stars. Stars that were once bound to their purpose began to have dreams and aspirations of their own. Some longed to be more than stewards. They sought crowns, worship, and dominion. These celestials became the **Aspirants** - stars that desired to be rulers. Others, steadfast in Solarin’s order, called themselves the **Faithbound**, committed to the original vision for the universe.

The two sides warred in heaven and on Caelthys. Elemental titans, dragons, and chosen mortals fought for their patrons. Seas boiled, mountains split, and Caelthys shattered into fragments. The continent was torn asunder and it now goes by a new name - **the Shattered Reach**.

In the end, the **Faithbound triumphed.** The Aspirants were stripped of their starfire and cast down, cursed to walk as mortals among the broken world they had marred. The heavens held order once more, though scarred by the war.

## The Aftermath
Thousands of years have passed since then. The fallen Aspirants mingled with mortals, seeding bloodlines and civilizations, but never regaining their celestial thrones. The conflicts since then have been mortal ones — wars of greed, ambition, and pride, fought without the direct hand of the stars. The Faithbound remained distant, operating as good stewards of the dominions to which they were assigned, but fearful to step out of line.
