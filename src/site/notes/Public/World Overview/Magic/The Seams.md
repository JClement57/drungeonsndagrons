### Overview

The **Seams** are rifts in the fabric of the world where the celestial force of **Aetherium** pools in unusually high concentrations. These sites are the lingering scars of the **Twilight Rebellion**, the great celestial war in which rebellious stars sought to overthrow **Solarin**. While the fabric of existence itself was wounded across it's entirety, sites where large battles during the rebellion took place were especially wounded and required a higher volume of Aetherium to mend. These nexuses of celestial energy became known as Seams. Seams vary in size. Large sites have become **elemental wastelands** often avoided by mortals. They are both sacred and dangerous, revered as sources of divine energy and feared as nexuses of elemental chaos. 

### Present Day
In the present day, Seams serve as both opportunities and threats:
- **Temples & Shrines:** Many faiths regard the Seams as sacred, sites where Lunira’s sacrifice can be most deeply felt.
- **Arcane Strongholds:** Empires and warlords often construct fortresses atop or near Seams, using their power to fuel devastating magical warfare.
- **Wild Regions:** Some Seams remain untamed, their elemental denizens and volatile magic making them inhospitable. These regions are often marked as forbidden, though scholars and treasure-seekers continue to risk entry.
    

### Notable Seams

Below is a list of recorded Seams, though scholars believe many remain undiscovered in distant lands or buried beneath the earth:

- **The Ashen Maw** – A volcanic chasm said to be the site where a fallen star was destroyed. Fire elementals swarm its molten rivers, and the land for miles is blackened by ash.
- **The Howling Expanse** – A vast desert scar where winds scream with unearthly voices. Air elementals drift freely across the dunes, and storms manifest without warning.
- **The Drowned Bastion** – A fortress half-sunk into an endless whirlpool at sea. Scholars claim it was built atop a Seam to harness its water-aspected power, but it has since become a haven for sahuagin and worse.
- **The Shattered Grove** – Once a verdant forest, this Seam was warped by necrotic energy during the Rebellion. Now a petrified wasteland, its trees animate with malicious intent, and whispers in the bark drive intruders mad.
- **The Silver Spire** – A mountain temple built upon a crystalline Seam. Pilgrims claim the spire sings with Lunira’s voice, though wizards note its magic strengthens divination and illusion spells to dangerous extremes.
