## 🗺️ Summary
_The party was informed by the adult myconids treating the wounds of Sinensa - the leader of the caves - that the origin of the blight seemed to be coming from the western caverns. As the party investigated, they found a crystal that was blocking a ventilation shaft in the western cavern. From below, the violet haze arose "from the depths", but our heroes don't know it's true source. After removing the crystal blocking the shaft, the fumes began to flow out of the caverns, relieving the blight of the Seagrow Caves. The myconids were grateful for all of their help._

_ Upon returning to Dragon's Rest, Tarok used some alchemist juju to create potions of the mushrooms that the party brought back from the caves. Jin talked with Runara about what could be "in the depths" and she revealed that, in the battle of the dragons, Sharruth was defeated by Bahamut and buried deep below the island.
Varnoth reminded the party to investigate the shipwreck on the North and see if they could figure out what was causing all the shipwrecks recently. Alaric, a guard of Dragon's Rest, accompanied the party to make sure they got to the beach safely and helped them defeat an owlbear on the way down to the beach._

## 📜 Key Events
- **Sinensa's Sanctum:** The party found the leader of the myconids covered in a purple blight which Enok said was coming from the western portion of the cave.  
- **The Crystal Cave:** Two fume drakes guarded a mysterious glowing crystal that turned out to be a fire snake egg that was redirecting noxious fumes from "the depths" into the myconids' caves. Defeating the fume drake, breaking the egg, and killing the fire snake began to allow for the fume to filter out of the caves, removing the blight from the Seagrow Caves.  
- **Jin's Dream:** Jin had a dream where a shooting star crashed into an estate, leaving nothing but rubble and cinders. He then heard the voice of a woman he loved, saying that despite the shame of surviving, he lived on for a reason. She would be with him in his blade, empowering him and equipping Jin and his new companions to defeat the evil that destroyed his lord's estate and "prevent the rise of a second sun".
- **Alaric:** The party was introduced to a cleric who serves as the guard for Dragon's Rest. He joined the party on the way down to the beach to fetch Tarok's boat since there had been rumblings of some dangers on the path. It ended up being an owlbear which Alaric and the party defeated easily.

## 🧩 Clues & Mysteries
- What is going on in "the depths"? What is the true source of the blight?
- The shipwrecks remain unexplored. What is causing all of these shipwrecks to occur all of the sudden? Could they be connected to the other things going on around the island?

<br>

## 📌 Player Notes
 - Jin used his poison breath attack down the mouth of a demoralized fume drake, only to find out the fume drake had an immunity to poison. The rest of the party perceived this as Jin making out with the drake
 - Leveled up to level 2!

>"You thought the snake was hot? The drake was way hotter!"
