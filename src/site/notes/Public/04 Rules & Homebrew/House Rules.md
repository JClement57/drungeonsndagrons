## Brutal Crits
 - Any attack that **beats*** the AC of it's target by 10 (i.e. 22 or more on an attack roll against a creature with 12 AC) is considered a **Brutal Critical Hit**
	 - On a brutal critical hit, **roll double dice** (i.e. 2d8 become 4d8) but only use the modifiers once (i.e. 1d6+4 becomes 2d6+4)
 - On regular critical hits (i.e. natural 20, unless a feat also allows 19 to be critical hits) **add one set of dice at the maximum possible roll**
	 - The creature who rolled the critical would only roll one set of dice as normal but then adding a maximum value roll to the rolled value
	 - For example, 1d8 + 3 would become 1d8 + 3 + 8 (with the final 8 points of damage being from the dice value) and 2d6 + 3 would become 2d6 + 3 + 12

## Familiars and Trained Pets
 - Familiars and pets that are sufficiently trained **do not need to take the owner's bonus action to take simple actions** like attacking a nearby enemy
 - Complicated commands still require a bonus action (at DM's discretion)

## Potions
 - Taking a healing potion is a **bonus action** rather than a full action
 - Administering a healing potion to another party member **still requires a full action**
