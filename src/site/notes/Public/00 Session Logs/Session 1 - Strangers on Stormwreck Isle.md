## 🗺️ Summary
*Four strangers—armed with secrets, paperwork, and varying levels of social skills—boarded a crusty old ferry called the **Gull's Grace** bound for **Stormwreck Isle**. There were two dragonborns who couldn't be more different named Jin and Z'rak, a cloaked enigma with a glowing sword named Kira, and a student who brought enough documentation to terrify a bureaucracy named Oly.*

*After a rocky voyage (and the utter destruction of some poor rats in the hold), the party arrived on the island, greeted by rainbow seaweed and zombie sailors who did not appreciate the warm welcome.*

*They climbed to the **Dragon’s Rest monastery**, where polite kobolds greeted them and brought them to their leader, **Runara**. The group was pointed to a suspiciously tattooed herbalist and a war-hero-turned-paperwork-victim where they learned there have been a lot of strange goings-on on Stormwreck Isle.*

*First it was off to a spooky cave where they met polite mushroom people, a giant octopus bouncer, and a few very angry fungi that almost killed Kira.*

*Now the mystery deepens... the mushrooms are sick, namely their leader, Sinensa, and it's up to the party to figure out what's going on and make things right*
