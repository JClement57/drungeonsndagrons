## 🗺️ Summary
_A group of bandits raided the city of Greymoor in the middle of the night. The party left their rooms in the Drowned Candle tavern to find bandits stealing women and children away from the town. After defeating the bandits the city guard captain, Elara Voss, came down from the northern street and made the party aware that a different raiding party had taken several women and children and gotten away._

The party then questioned Turok and discovered that the Reavers are headquartered at an abandoned lumber mill an hour east along the river. The party, along with their new friend Norin the dwarf, disguised themselves as Reavers and set out for the mill in the middle of the night. They arrived and infiltrated the mill and found where the prisoners were being kept before fighting broke out... Will they survive and free the captives or will they themselves become victims of the trafficking ring?
