## Live Notes
 - One of the attackers had a signet ring of the Ebony Hand
 - Attackers were flanked by the guard who was outside of Arthur's office when we got there
 - They were going to take us to "a path behind the harbormaster's shack leads to a cave in the side of the cliffs"
 - Ledger from the Ebony Hand looking for our party
	 - Ledge was written with a unique magical ink that matches the ink on the ledger we found at the lumber mill
 - Prisoner (Braun) left with guards to be taken to jail 
 - Lord Gill Bellarose - leader of the house
	 - House Bellarose took Braun, who at this point was totally concussed and thought he was 17 and lived in Aelinar
 - The session ended with a woman who matches the description of Lady Genevieve Valerius hobbling into town
