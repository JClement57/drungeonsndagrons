# Welcome to the World of Caelthys
Caelthys is a world shaped by the watchful glow of its distant celestials, where ancient mountain confederacies, fractured faiths, and rising rebellions strain against the cosmic order. Magic flows from the stars themselves, touching lands divided by harsh climates, old grudges, and the shifting influence of divine powers. Mortals forge their own destinies beneath a sky that is never truly silent, dreaming, fighting, and surviving in a realm where forgotten myths stir and celestial forces cast long shadows across the world.

Yet the fate of Caelthys is far from written. As ancient powers stir and the heavens themselves tremble, the world looks to a handful of rising heroes—wanderers, rebels, students, and champions whose choices will ripple far beyond the lands they walk. Will they uphold the celestial order or challenge it? Will they mend old wounds or tear open new ones? In a world where even the stars can falter, the path they choose may decide not only the future of Caelthys, but the balance of the skies above.
