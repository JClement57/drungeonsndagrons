# 🐉 Welcome to the Campaign Wiki!

## 🎲 What is this?

Welcome adventurers!  
This is the **official campaign wiki** for our Dungeons & Dragons game.  
It serves as a living archive of our world, your adventures, and all the colorful characters, places, and mysteries you’ll encounter.

Think of it as both:

- 📚 **An encyclopedia** of the world, containing lore, locations, important NPCs, deities, maps, and more.
    
- 🗺 **A campaign log**, tracking your party’s deeds, current quests, and memorable moments.
