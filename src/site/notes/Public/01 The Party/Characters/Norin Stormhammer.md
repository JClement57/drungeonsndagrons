## Background

Norin Stormhammer was born to the forge. A blacksmith by trade, he spent his youth shaping hammers, axes, and armor for his kin in the mountain city of Khar Vuraz. His life was fire, sweat, and ringing steel — honest work that gave him pride. But in the deep places where he mined for ore to fuel his craft, he uncovered something unlike any vein he had seen before: a shard of strange metal, cold to the touch yet shimmering faintly with veins of light.

Curious, Norin brought the find back to his forge. He heated it, hammered it, tested it — but the metal resisted every blow. At last, he hurled it into the heart of his furnace, determined to break it open. The shard cracked — not like stone, but like an egg. From within spilled a rush of heat and starlight, and a spectral dragon emerged, wings curling with smoke and flame. It fixed him with eyes both ancient and newborn before curling up in the ashes beside the bellows.

That night, Norin dreamed of a radiant forge unlike any in the mortal world, where even the flames burned with starlight. Upon the anvil rested a weapon wrought of a metal he had never seen before — shining, unyielding, divine. Starmetal, the celestial metal of myth. The vision burned in his heart. When he woke, the spectral drake stood beside his bedroll, watching him. Its gaze carried no words, but its meaning was clear: seek the forge, find the metal, and forge the axe from his vision.

Norin does not know why the dream was sent to him, nor what fate the celestials have in store, but he knows his path is no longer the quiet life of a smith. With his hammers at his side and the draconic spirit bound to him, he has set out into the wide world. Somewhere out there lies the Forge of Stars, the scattered shards of starmetal, and the destiny he has yet to understand.
