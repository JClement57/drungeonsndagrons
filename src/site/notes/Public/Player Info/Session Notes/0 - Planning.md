# Goal/Priorities
 - Enjoy the game and have fun
 - Tell a fun story
 - Showcase different DMs
 - Get to level 20!

# Scheduling
 - How regularly do we want to play?
 - Same day/time each week?
 - Online vs. In-Person
	 - Discord?
 - Saturday morning or Sunday Afternoons every 2/3 weeks
 
# Rotating DM 
 - Arc length
	 - Flexible - as long as you want to DM for
	 - Can be anywhere from 1 session to 12?
 - Handoffs
	 - Coordinate with upcoming DM about how you will handoff. Try and add relatively clean breaks/conclusions
 - Rotation?
	 - How will we decide who goes next? Predefined order?
 - Shared Lore (Google Drive + Obsidian?)
	 - Maps

# Vibe/Tone
 - Intra-party conflict?
 - Danger level?
 - Death/Permanent Consequences?
	 - Death is allowed. DM's should try to challenge the players and if that does eventually lead to death of a character, then we will work together to find a way for that person to continue to play in an enjoyable way
 - Traps?
 - DND Bucket List (E.g., dragon heist, masquerade ball, mass battle)
	 - Mike - Run a heist
	 - 

# Restrictions
We want to avoid anything demonic. Probably avoiding the hells in general. Warlock levels can be permitted on a case-by-case basis. Pantheons are A-OK - (i.e. evil gods trying to destroy the world or something), just trying to avoid strictly demonic things. 

# Characters
Katy
Landon
Mike
Hailey
Josh

Any joint character arcs/stories?

# Revisions / Homebrew
During gameplay, discuss with the current DM
 - Moving companions does not require a bonus action
 - Brutal Criticals
 - 

# Leveling
Milestone leveling. We'll level up really quickly at the beginning (level 4 at the end of Stormwreck Isle). It'll probably slow down after that.

# Content Preferences
 - Combat vs. RP vs. Exploration vs Puzzles

	 - Shared continents that are not yet filled in and will be filled as we go
		 - When you are DM-ing, fill in as you create new places
