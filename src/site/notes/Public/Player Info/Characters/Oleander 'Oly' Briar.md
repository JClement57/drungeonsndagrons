## Background

Oleander Briar, 'Oly', is not an adventurer. As a wizarding student at the Moondrop Academy, Oly would rather read a book than talk to a person, let alone go on an adventure. But after being forced on a field practicum for school, Oly embarks on a quest at Stormwreck Isle with every intention of returning to her cozy book nook with her Salamander familiar (Oggy) as soon as possible. But after a psychic message from her mother that warns of danger infiltrating her academy and 'them' hunting her, Oly is forced to stay with the crew she met on Stormwreck until she figures out how she can return. Her magic skills, and some odd skills (like speaking theives cant?), might just help her as she's forced into a life of adventure (hopefully temporarily🤞).
