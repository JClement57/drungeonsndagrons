## The Old Regime

Before it became the Redwynn Empire the region existed under the banner of the **Kingdom of Condsor** rule by an authoritarian monarch named **Gregor Hargrave**. This old king believed themselves to be chosen by the stars and used this vision to justify cruelty against their people. They used heavy taxation to fund their state-controlled religion that began to paint the old king as a god himself.

## The Condsor Revolution

Seamus Redwynn was the face of a rebellion against the Condsor king's authoritarian rule. Upon the conclusion of the rebellion and victory for the revolution Seamus took the seat of Emperor and appointed his most trusted advisors and friends as the first mayors of the cities of the Empire. 

Emperor Seamus promised that the Empire would be a place that did good by it's people. He stays in the seat of Emperor to maintain the principles that he sought to set in place.

## Government

### National Governance

Seamus Redwynn II is the found Emperor and the ultimate sovereign of the Redwynn Empire.

### Local Governance

Each major city is largely autonomous in daily affairs, governed by an **elected mayor** who answers ultimately to the Emperor. This layered system ensures local voices are heard but keeps the throne’s authority intact.

Each mayor has a council which could be made up of local guild masters, heads of houses, or other relevant characters in a city.

## Economy

The Redwynn Empire thrives on trade. Merchant guilds and artisan syndicates wield enormous influence, funding civic projects, sponsoring festivals, and sometimes even employing private guards or spies. This fierce competition for wealth drives innovation — but also greed.

Where coin flows freely, shadows inevitably gather. Smuggling, extortion, and clandestine pacts flourish beneath Redwynn’s glittering facade. Some say certain mayors even turn a blind eye, provided their coffers stay full.

## Culture & Reputation

Redwynners are proud, fashion-conscious, and quick to boast of their empire’s wealth. Festivals honoring trade victories and exotic foreign fairs are common, filling the streets with color, song, and visiting merchants from faraway lands.
