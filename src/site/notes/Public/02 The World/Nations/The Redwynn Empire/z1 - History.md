## The Old Regime

Before it became the Redwynn Empire the region existed under the banner of the **Kingdom of Condsor** rule by an authoritarian monarch named **Gregor Hargrave**. This old king believed themselves to be chosen by the stars and used this vision to justify cruelty against their people. They used heavy taxation to fund their state-controlled religion that began to paint the old king as a god himself.

## The Condsor Revolution

Seamus Redwynn was the face of a rebellion against the Condsor king's authoritarian rule. Upon the conclusion of the rebellion and victory for the revolution Seamus took the seat of Emperor and appointed his most trusted advisors and friends as the first mayors of the cities of the Empire. 

Emperor Seamus promised that the Empire would be a place that did good by it's people. He stays in the seat of Emperor to maintain the principles that he sought to set in place.
