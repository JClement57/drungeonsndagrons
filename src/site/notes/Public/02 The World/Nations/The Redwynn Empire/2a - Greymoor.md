**Type:** Small coastal town  
**Population:** ~350  
**Region:** Western coast of the [[Public/02 The World/Nations/The Redwynn Empire/0 - The Redwynn Empire\|Redwynn Empire]], across the sea from [[Public/02 The World/Nations/The Redwynn Empire/Stormwreck Isle\|Stormwreck Isle]]

## Overview

Greymoor is a modest, fog-choked town perched on the western coast of the Redwynn Empire, where the rocky shore gives way to weather-worn docks that have long served as its lifeline. Frequent mists roll in from the sea, lending the wooden streets and leaning buildings a somber, gray hue that inspired the town’s name.

Most structures are timber-built and appear aged, with dark stains from years of salt and damp. Moss crawls up stone foundations, and rooftops sag under the weight of constant drizzle. Though it may seem dour at first glance, Greymoor is known for the hardiness and quiet hospitality of its folk.

## Government

Greymoor is governed by a small council of elders, headed by **Elder Calwin Dreel**, a retired shipwright who has lived here most of his life. The council handles disputes, trade arrangements, and oversees local defenses.

Law and order is maintained by the **Town Guard**, commanded by **Captain Tolen Brask**, who is respected for his fair but stern approach to justice. For most small issues, disputes are settled by local custom or by Calwin’s level-headed mediation.

## Religions

The town is home to a modest shrine where locals give quiet thanks to gods of the sea and safe passage. Offerings to **Procan**, god of the sea and storms, are especially common, as are occasional tokens to **Chauntea**, goddess of agriculture, for the small gardens and livestock kept by villagers.

The shrine sits near the center of town, a simple stone circle with weathered driftwood carvings and colored ribbons tied around posts.

## Popular Places  

#### **The Drowned Candle**

A cozy tavern and inn operated by **Halgrin Moss**, known for his sharp tongue and rich, spicy fish stew. It’s a favorite gathering spot for sailors, traders, and townsfolk alike, offering hearty meals, stout ales, and news from passing ships.

#### **The Market Square**

A modest open area surrounded by wood-plank stalls. Locals sell smoked fish, pickled vegetables, rough-spun wool, simple wood carvings, and imported odds and ends brought in by coastal traders. The market is busiest on market days, when folk from nearby hamlets come to barter.

#### **Greymoor Docks**

The beating heart of the town. Several long piers stretch into the cold sea, lined with fishing boats and merchant sloops. Crates of salted fish, barrels of pitch, and bundles of nets often lie stacked nearby.
