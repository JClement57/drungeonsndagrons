## Overview

Emberwatch is the second-largest city in the [[Public/02 The World/Nations/The Redwynn Empire/0 - The Redwynn Empire\|the Redwynn Empire]] , a thriving hub of trade and defense located **about a half-day's boat ride up river from the western coast**, linked to the sea by the wide and navigable **Ravenflow River**. Merchant vessels, fishing boats, and river barges travel daily between Emberwatch and the coastal ports, making the city a vital artery for commerce.

Its imposing walls and towers stand as both deterrent and promise — a city that has endured for generations, proud of its role as the western guardian of the realm.

At the heart of Emberwatch rises the black stone **Ember Tower**, crowned with a magical flame that burns eternally and can be seen even from the coast. It remains the city’s defining landmark and symbol.

## Population

Approximately **22,000 permanent residents**, bolstered by a constant influx of traders, sailors, craftsmen, and adventurers. The people of Emberwatch are industrious and proud, though whispers of growing dangers beyond the city have begun to unsettle them.
<br>

## Government

Emberwatch is governed by an **elected mayor**, chosen by the citizenry every five years, who works in concert (and frequent contention) with a **council of guildmasters**. Each major guild elects its own representative, giving them a powerful voice in city affairs.

While the mayor seeks to balance the interests of all, the guildmasters often feud over resources and influence, making politics in Emberwatch a delicate dance. All ultimately serve under the authority of the kingdom’s monarch, though the crown rarely intervenes directly.

## Religion

Due to the history of the Redwynn Empire - specifically the Condsor King's striving for godhood - religion holds only a minor foothold as a background feature in Emberwatch. Regardless, there is still a small presence of reverence for the Celestials.

 - **The Astral Hall** - A small place of worship for the celestials. Not dedicated to any particular celestial and isn't supremely popular.

## Market & Commerce

Thanks to the Ravenflow River, Emberwatch is a **trade powerhouse**, serving as the main inland depot for goods flowing to and from the coast. Its famed market districts include:

- **The Condsor Commons** - The scaffolding of the temple that was being constructed to **Gregor Hargrave** during the time of the Kingdom of Condsor has since taken root as the cultural center in the city. It is known as the **Condsor Commons** and serves as a marketplace and gathering space in the center of the city. 
    
- **Guildwalk**, an area dominated by the headquarters and workshops of powerful trade guilds, who oversee everything from shipbuilding contracts to magical item registration.

Local exports include fine textiles, crafted metalworks, river fish, and goods transshipped from coastal merchants.

## The People & Atmosphere

Emberwatch’s citizens are proud of their city’s reputation as the western shield of the kingdom. They place trust in their walls, the disciplined guard, and the longstanding traditions of governance that have kept them safe for centuries.

Yet recently, troubling tales from merchants and guards — of vanished caravans, mysterious lights in the forests, and ships that never return — have begun to sow quiet worry. Most dismiss these fears, convinced the city is too strong to truly be threatened. Whether that faith is well-placed remains to be seen.
