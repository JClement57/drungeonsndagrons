The **Tzicali Isles** form a striking archipelago of verdant, misty islands scattered across warm tropical seas. Beneath their vibrant jungles lie titanic, dormant forms of ancient god-beasts — colossal remnants from a war of the gods, whose uneasy slumber occasionally sends tremors across the land.

The Isles are a land of **competing noble houses**, each ruling over their own island or stretch of coastline, locked in a delicate and ever-shifting game of feudal alliances, betrayals, and open war. Yet amidst their rivalry, all houses pay homage to the astronomer-priests who stand as spiritual stewards over the Isles, interpreting the movements of the stars and the whispers of the sleeping titans.

## Government & Power

The Tzicali Isles operate under a **feudal system**, with lords and ladies (known as **Tlatoani** and **Tlatoya**) who control territories, raise militias, and scheme to expand their holdings. Their strongholds — stone keeps adorned with jungle motifs — dot the islands, while knights and samurai-like retainers uphold their honor and defend their claims.

Political life resembles the cutthroat court intrigue of medieval England: arranged marriages, secret assassinations, and ever-shifting loyalties define the noble game. Battles are frequent but rarely total, as every house fears stirring the titans beneath them with prolonged, devastating warfare.

## Samurai Tradition

**[[Public/02 The World/Nations/The Tzicali Isles/Tzicali Warrior Traditions\|Martial traditions]]** flourish across the Tzicali Isles, where **warrior clans known as the Tiwi and the Balami** hold deep cultural significance. The Tiwi — eagle-inspired warriors — act as noble defenders of peace and freedom, upholding ancient codes of conduct and spiritual guardianship. In contrast, the jaguar-inspired Balami serve as mercenaries and power brokers, often employed by feuding lords to enforce will through strength. While both warrior traditions command respect, their conflicting ideals reflect the divided soul of the archipelago itself.

## Religion

The Tzicali people share a fervent, unifying faith centered on the **moon, stars, and the slumbering titans**. Religion draws heavily from Aztec-inspired rites, with elaborate ceremonies conducted atop stepped temples to read omens, perform ritual animal sacrifices, and keep the titans dormant. 

The high priests, called **Starreaders**, hold immense moral and cultural sway. No noble would dare openly defy them, and even the fiercest rival lords meet in uneasy truces during holy festivals, lest they anger the heavens above or the titans below.

## People & Culture

Life in the Isles is rich with pageantry: brightly painted masks, night markets illuminated by thousands of lanterns, and grand tournaments where knights/samurai test their mettle. Nobles host elaborate feasts where politics blend with ritual, and commoners pay tribute in produce and craftwork.

The common folk farm terraced jungle plots, fish the warm seas, and gather rare herbs, while artisans carve intricate glyphs and weave vibrant tapestries that record the stars’ movements and noble lineages.

## Economy & Trade

The Isles export vibrant dyes, rare medicinal plants, jade carvings, and exotic beast hides. Trade flows through bustling coastal towns and river ports, though always under the watchful eyes of local lords who demand tariffs. Mercenary companies and wandering knights/samurai often escort caravans to deter bandits or rival house raids.
