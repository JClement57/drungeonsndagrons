### Overview

The **Seams** are rifts in the fabric of Caelthys where the celestial force known as **Aetherium** gathers in volatile concentration. These are the lingering scars of the **Twilight Rebellion**, when the Stars waged war against **Solarin** for dominion over the heavens.

As the Faithbound and Aspirants clashed through their mortal avatars, the fury of their divine power tore holes in the very weave of existence. Where the greatest battles raged, creation itself began to unravel. In the war’s aftermath, **Lunira** sought to mend the wounded world. Through her light, Aetherium flowed into these ruptures, sealing them enough to keep the world whole. Yet even her power could not fully heal the wounds—only bind them.

These bound scars became the **Seams**: nexuses of raw celestial energy where the barrier between realms remains thin. Some shimmer faintly across the landscape, while others gape as vast, unstable rifts that reshape the land around them. The largest Seams have become **elemental wastelands**—realms where divine energy bleeds into the material plane, birthing storms of fire, floods of living crystal, and winds that sing with divine echoes.

To mortals, the Seams are both sacred and perilous—revered as fonts of divine creation and feared as the remnants of a war that nearly tore the world apart.

### Present Day
In the present day, Seams serve as both opportunities and threats:
- **Temples & Shrines:** Many faiths regard the Seams as sacred, sites where Lunira’s sacrifice can be most deeply felt.
- **Arcane Strongholds:** Empires and warlords often construct fortresses atop or near Seams, using their power to fuel devastating magical warfare.
- **Wild Regions:** Some Seams remain untamed, their elemental denizens and volatile magic making them inhospitable. These regions are often marked as forbidden, though scholars and treasure-seekers continue to risk entry.
    

### Notable Seams

Below is a list of recorded Seams, though scholars believe many remain undiscovered in distant lands or buried beneath the earth:

- **The Ashen Maw** – A volcanic chasm said to be the site where a fallen star was destroyed. Fire elementals swarm its molten rivers, and the land for miles is blackened by ash.
- **The Howling Expanse** – A vast desert scar where winds scream with unearthly voices. Air elementals drift freely across the dunes, and storms manifest without warning.
- **The Drowned Bastion** – A fortress half-sunk into an endless whirlpool at sea. Scholars claim it was built atop a Seam to harness its water-aspected power, but it has since become a haven for sahuagin and worse.
- **The Shattered Grove** – Once a verdant forest, this Seam was warped by necrotic energy during the Rebellion. Now a petrified wasteland, its trees animate with malicious intent, and whispers in the bark drive intruders mad.
- **The Silver Spire** – A mountain temple built upon a crystalline Seam. Pilgrims claim the spire sings with Lunira’s voice, though wizards note its magic strengthens divination and illusion spells to dangerous extremes.
