> “In the dark before time, a will awoke and saw nothing. To end the nothing, it became light.”

Before any stories began, there was darkness. And then there was light.  
Forged by his own will, Solarin rose from the void — the first flame, the first thought. His first act of creation was himself.

### **Caelthys**
In defiance of the endless dark that he had pierced with his own light, Solarin shaped a world to mirror his own radiant purpose. Thus was born **Caelthys**, a realm of divine order where all things moved in harmony beneath his eternal light. He breathed life into man and beast alike and set them to roam and tame the land. Their numbers flourished, and their joy became his own. The world was perfect — predictable, peaceful, forever bathed in his glow.

### **The Stars**

Yet as his creation grew, Solarin’s burden grew with it. To ease his labor, he forged the **Stars**, a cosmic legion of stewards, each granted dominion over a sacred domain — land and sea, harvest and love, and countless more. Entrusting them with the care of Caelthys, Solarin rested, content to watch his creation thrive in perfect order.

#### The Veil
To preserve this harmony, Solarin raised a radiant **veil** between realms — a barrier of divine light separating the **Celestial Realm** from **Caelthys**. Through it, his Stars could watch and guide, but never fully touch the mortal world. This assured his order would be maintained.

#### Celestial Law and the Krisis
As Solarin began distributing power and authority amongst the stars he also created the [[Public/02 The World/History & Lore/Celestial Pantheon/Celestial Law\|../../../02 The World/History & Lore/Celestial Pantheon/Celestial Law]] - a set of rules that all members of the cosmic legion abided by. 

To enforce his divine order, Solarin forged the **Krisis** — a spear of purest light capable of piercing even the radiant veil. With it, he could cast judgment upon the Stars who defied the celestial code, striking them from the heavens and casting their brilliance down into the mortal realm. The Vaelspire became both the instrument of divine justice and the symbol of Solarin’s ultimate authority.

### **Lunira**
Perfection dulled with time. Solarin longed for something new — for wonder.  
From his yearning, he shaped the moon, **Lunira**, to weave mystery into the tapestry of his world.  
With her rising came the first cycles: day and night, ebb and tide, season and storm.  
Through her soft light, mortals dreamed, invented, and began to see beauty not only in the known, but in the unknown.  
Caelthys entered a golden age of prosperity, growth and imagination.

### **Beautiful Chaos**

From the gift of change sprang conflict. Dreams gave birth to desire, and desire to greed.  
Mortals warred, kingdoms rose and fell, and the perfect order fractured into countless shades of light and shadow.

Still, Solarin watched in silence. For within their chaos, he saw something greater than order — choice.  
And though the fires of strife burned brightly, so too did compassion, courage, and love.  
Thus did Solarin leave the fate of Caelthys to its own making - a grand experiment to see whether light or darkness would prevail.
