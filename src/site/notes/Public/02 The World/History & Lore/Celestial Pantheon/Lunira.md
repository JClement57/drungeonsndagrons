**Lunira** is the second celestial, born in the shadow of the Sun’s radiance. She governs all that shifts, fades, evolves, or transforms. Where [[Public/02 The World/History & Lore/Celestial Pantheon/Solarin\|Solarin]] creates and defines, Lunira disturbs and redefines. Her domain includes death, the sea, storms, dreams, and deception—anything that cannot be pinned down or permanently held.

While the Sun ensures the world functions, the Moon ensures that it **evolves**. She guides endings toward new beginnings and allows space for secrets, chaos, and uncertainty to exist. Though often associated with trickery or darkness, she is also the comforter of the grieving, the guide of souls, and the patron of change.

The Moon does not oppose the Sun; she complements him, shaping what he creates and ensuring the eternal cycle of beginnings and endings continues.

### Description  
Where Solarin brings clarity, **Lunira** embraces the unknown. As the moon changes shape every night, she rules the **in-between**, the borderlands of life and death, dusk and dawn, silence and song. She governs storms, shadows, and the delicate balance of endings and beginnings.

Lunira does not create, but **transforms**. The dying find passage through her. The secrets whispered in dreams are hers to keep. Her beauty is mesmerizing and terrible—a face you can never see fully, a truth you feel but cannot name.

### Personality
Elusive, mercurial, and enigmatic. Lunira is a trickster, a mourner, a storm that passes as quickly as it comes. She speaks in riddles and dreams. She loves deeply and mourns eternally, especially the stars she once bore from Solarin’s fire.

### Worshippers  
Sailors, mourners, spies, storm-callers, gravekeepers, assassins, and dreamers. Many pray to her at dusk, especially those in grief or fear.
