## Overview
To maintain order in the celestial realm, [[Public/02 The World/History & Lore/Celestial Pantheon/Solarin\|Solarin]] created the [[Public/02 The World/History & Lore/Celestial Pantheon/Celestial Law\|Celestial Code]] - a set of laws that governed all beings in the celestial realm. Any breach of these laws would be met with immediate banishment from the celestial realm. Upon banishment stars lose all but a sliver of their radiant power reducing them to mere mortals.

## The Celestial Commandments
##### **The Law of the Eclipse**
- No star may challenge, rival, or attempt to equal the Sun’s light.
- To do so is an act of war against the Sun God.

##### **The Law of Appointed Domain**
- Each star is assigned a specific domain, territory, or concept
- Leaving your domain without Sun’s command is forbidden.'

##### **The Law of the Constellation**
- Stars must remain in their ordained place in the cosmic order. To move from your constellation without decree is considered **treason**.

##### **The Law of the Veil**
- Celestial truths are **not for mortal minds**. The full knowledge of the heavens must never be revealed.
- Too much divine knowledge can cause madness, heresy, or war.

##### **The Law of Purity**
- No celestial may mingle their essence with mortals or other forbidden beings (fiends, undead, aberrations).
- This includes siring half-celestial children, creating mixed beings, or sharing divine power directly.
