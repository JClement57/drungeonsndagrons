### **The Celestial Realm**

Above all existence lies the Celestial Realm, the radiant dominion of **Solarin**, **Lunira**, and the **Stars**. It is a place of pure light and divine order, where the currents of **Aetherium** flow unbound and creation itself bends to celestial will. Only beings of immense power may dwell here, for its brilliance would unmake any mortal form.

### **The Radiant Veil**

Separating heaven from the mortal world is the **Radiant Veil**, an eternal barrier of blinding light woven by Solarin after the Twilight Rebellion. It seals the Celestial Realm from Caelthys below, preventing direct divine influence. The Veil shimmers faintly in the heavens, visible as the auroras that dance across the night sky.

---

### **The Skies**

Between the Veil and the land stretches the boundless **Skies**, where winds, storms, and drifting islands carry traces of Aetherium’s breath. Elemental beings and dragons once soared freely here, though few remain after the Rebellion’s ruin. Scholars say the skies still hum with celestial resonance — echoes of the stars that once walked among mortals.

### **The Shattered Reach**

The **Shattered Reach** forms the uppermost layer of **Caelthys**, a broken world of continents and seas torn apart by celestial war. Mortals of every kind make their homes here, upon the scars of Solarin’s creation. Though beauty and ruin coexist across its lands, the Reach remains the cradle of civilization and the heart of mortal endeavor.

### **The Shadowscape**

A mile beneath the surface sprawls the **Shadowscape**, a vast network of caverns and chasms carved by the **Aspirants** as refuge during the Twilight Rebellion. In the ages since, it has become home to those shaped by darkness and exile — the **drow**, **tieflings**, **duergar**, and **deep gnomes**. Though some have returned to the surface, most dwell in the depths, thriving in the dim glow of crystal-lit cities far from Solarin’s light.

---

### **The Abyss**

Below the Shadowscape festers the **Abyss**, the prison of Solarin’s fallen armies. Banished when the **Krisis** was claimed by the Faithbound, these once-radiant hosts have been twisted by madness and voidlight. The Abyss is a place of endless descent — a realm of horrors where even celestial memory decays. Few who venture there ever return.

### **The Void**

At the foundation of existence lies the **Void** — a fathomless expanse beyond light, time, or reason. Nothing lives within it, yet whispers claim it hungers. Some believe it to be the tomb of **Vaelen**, the rogue star, while others call it the unformed darkness that existed before Solarin’s first light. All agree on one truth: the Void is the end of all things.
