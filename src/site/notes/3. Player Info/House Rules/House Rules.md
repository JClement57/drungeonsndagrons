# Brutal Criticals
 - On a natural 20 on the die, a player (or creature) rolls the regular amount of damage dice, and then adds a maximum possible damage dice to whatever they rolled
	 - **EXAMPLE:** A player were to land a natural 20 critical (a brutal critical) with an attack with 2d8 as the damage dice, they would roll 2d8 and add 16 to whatever they rolled and that would be their final damage. 
 - If the attacker doesn't roll a natural 20 but roll to hit exceeds the target's armor class by 10 (i.e. AC of 13, 23 to hit), the attacker may roll double dice
	 - **EXAMPLE:** An attacker rolls 23 to hit (18 + 5) against a creature with an armor class of 12, and the attacked is wielding a longsword (1d10), they would roll 2d10 for damage.


# Trained Companions
 - Companions that are trained or bonded to a player may be given simple commands via a free action rather than a bonus action
	 - These actions include movement, attacking or dodge
 - Complex actions that would take explaining still require the bonus action
	 - The determination of the complexity of an action is up to the discretion of the DM
